In this paper we describe several computer-assisted lower bounds on the size of garbled circuits.
This repository contains files and programs that can be used to replicate and extend our bounds.

* `Citip` links to our fork of the [Citip](https://github.com/coldfix/Citip) prover for information theory inequalities. We added several new features, which are described in our paper.
* `.citip` files are the inputs to Citip
* `.proof` are the outputs of Citip
* `check_proof.py` can be used to verify the output proof
