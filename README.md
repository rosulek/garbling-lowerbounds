In this paper we describe several computer-assisted lower bounds on the size of garbled circuits.
This repository contains files and programs that can be used to replicate and extend our bounds.

* `Citip` links to [our fork of](https://github.com/ldr709/Citip) the [Citip](https://github.com/coldfix/Citip) prover for information theory inequalities. We added several new features, which are described in our paper.
* `*.citip` files are the inputs to Citip, the meaning of which is described described in our paper.
* `*.proof` files are the outputs of Citip
* `check_proof.py` can be used to verify the output proof
